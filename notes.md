1. Set up the file structure
    bundle gem run_log in terminal
    create repo in github and push
    mkdir -p app/models
    mkdir app/views
    mkdir app/controllers
    touch app/controllers/application_controller.rb
    mkdir config
    touch config/envrionment.rb
    mkdir db
    mkdir -p public/stylesheets
    touch public/stylesheets/main.css
    touch README.md (already done if run with bundle gem)
    touch CONTRIBUTING.md (already done if run with bundle gem)
    touch LICENSE.md (already done if run with bundle gem)
    touch config.ru
    git add .
    git commit -m 'added file structure'

    ├── config
    │ └── environment.rb - Use file to connect up all files within the app, file loads bundler and all gems in gemfile 
    ├── config.ru - Used for Rack based applications and for using Shotgun
    ├── db
        - User - Needs a unique username and password_digest
        - Log 
    ├── public - holds front end assets such as css stylesheets and javascript directories 


2. Set up gemfile and bundle install gems
3. Build out requirement file 
4. Build out config.ru file
5. Build out application_controller.rb
6. Add index.erb file in views and run shotgun to test functionality
7. Setup Rakefile - add required fields
    require ‘./config/environment’ #requiring the environment file
    require ‘sinatra/activerecord/rake’ #loads Rake tasks
8. Create DB migration
    - for every table created, create a corresponding model class in models director, and a controller 
    - Could use corneal scaffold NAME to set up folder structure and delete out spec file 
    - Created Users table - Every user should have a unique username and password digest
    - Create Log table - Every log should have a date, userid, etc.
        - have foreign key of user id
    - Rake db:migrate

9. Models - The logic of the web app. This is where data is manipulated/saved
    - User has many logs
    - User has secure password
    - Logs belong to Users
10. Views - The front end of the user facing part of the application. Has CSS, HTML, and Javascript. This is the only thing the user interacts with directly
11. Controllers - Go between for models and views - relays data from the view to the model and then back to the view
12. View --> Controller --> Model --> Controller --> View 
13. MVC allows for organization and to keep files seperated using seperation of concerns
